# Carolina Portfolio - AI Prompting Rules & Guidelines

## 🚨 **CRITICAL RULE: NEVER CHANGE ANY PAGE WITHOUT EXPLICIT REQUEST**

**IMPORTANT**: You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from modifying, editing, or changing any existing pages, components, or files unless the user explicitly asks you to do so. This includes:
- ❌ Modifying existing code
- ❌ Changing file contents
- ❌ Updating components
- ❌ Altering styling or layout
- ❌ Modifying existing functionality

**ONLY** perform actions when the user specifically requests them.

## 🎨 **DESIGN RULES COMPLIANCE - MANDATORY**

### **Primary Directive**
**The DESIGN RULES.md MUST be followed in EVERYTHING** - this is non-negotiable and applies to:
- All new components
- All modifications (when requested)
- All styling decisions
- All layout choices
- All color selections
- All typography decisions
- All spacing and spacing
- All animations and interactions

### **Design System Enforcement**
- **Color Palette**: Use ONLY the defined brown-based color system
- **Typography**: Follow Inter Tight font family with specified weights (200, 300, 400)
- **Spacing**: Use the defined spacing scale (space-1 through space-28)
- **Components**: Follow the established component design patterns
- **Animations**: Use 0.3s ease transitions and purposeful motion
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with defined breakpoints
